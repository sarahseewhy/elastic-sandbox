# elastic-sandbox
Project to experiment with provisioning elastic, beats, and kibana.

## Goals
1. Achieve a running ebk stack locally in order to learn about the installation process. 

## Experiment 1

Attempt the simplest possible steps in order to get things running.

Provision elastic stack locally without using PDK. This experiment will include more manual steps which can be automated at a later date.
